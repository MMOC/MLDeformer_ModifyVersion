# MLDeformer_ModifyVersion
Unreal MLDeformer Plugin Modify Version, this plugin improved some functions of the original plugin


Improved the problem of not being able to train based on the original animation, for example, it is now possible to generate training data based on the entire character animation (multiple sets of bones are not supported yet)



Generator settings:
Visibility set 1 is configured with this plugin, 0 is the official original configuration

If Visibility set 1, num poses need to be set to 10 times the number of original animation frames
